scrapy is a Python library that was created to scrape the web and build web crawlers. It is fast, simple, and can navigate through multiple web pages without much effort.

Scrapy is available through the Pip Installs Python (PIP) library, here's a refresher on how to install PIP on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
